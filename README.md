# Missing Error Handling in Next.js getServerSideProps()

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: missing error handling within `getServerSideProps()`.  The `About` page fetches data from an external API.  If the API request fails (due to network issues, API downtime, or other reasons), the application will crash without proper error handling.

## Bug

The `pages/about.js` file attempts to fetch data using `fetch`. However, it lacks error handling.  If the `fetch` call fails, the promise will reject, causing the page to render incorrectly or not at all.  The `JSON.stringify` may also throw an error if `data` is undefined.

## Solution

The solution includes robust error handling within `getServerSideProps()`.  The code now checks for network errors and API errors.  If an error occurs, it gracefully handles the situation, preventing application crashes and providing a user-friendly error message.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. The default version will likely fail if the example API is unavailable. You can modify the API url to one that is working to test both versions. 
6. The fixed version will display a user-friendly message if the API request fails.
